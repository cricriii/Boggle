At that time, it was announced by the STM that three stations on the blue line would be close due to some negligeance abount maintenance; the stations in question are Fabre, D'Iberville and St-Michel. As a temporary solution, the STM offered to put in place some shuttle buses. \\\\\n",

My research was unsuccessful and all I could find was the average of 1,029,300 daily unlinked passenger trips per weekday and 2023's report of the numbers of entries in the most busy stations for the year so I decided to do some estimations.\n",

Dividing it by 365 days, we get an average of 8061 entries per day. Dividing it once again by approximately 20 hours of operating time, we get an average of 403 entries per hour.\n",
